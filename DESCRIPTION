Description: MiniCN is a lightweight pipeline for gene copy-number calling on small, amplicon-based targeted panels (\< 1 Mb) using GATK-like coverage files. It supports either matched tumor–normal pairs or a pool-of-normals (PON) for coverage normalization. MiniCN was originally created for a \~20-gene panel (\~60 kb) with amplicons covering full exons, and introns for a subset of genes.
